# Flavorus

An application for users to discover new movies and new tv shows based on a specific movie/tv show they love.

## Motivation

I am sure anyone and everyone who has finished watching a great movie or tv show wondered where they could search to find the next great entertainment experience. Instead of surfing the web for similar movies/tv shows and doing research on multiple sites, this application can help you find that all in one place.
